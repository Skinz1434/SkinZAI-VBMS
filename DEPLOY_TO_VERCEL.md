# 🚀 Fixed Vercel Deployment Guide for SkinZAI VBMS

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Monorepo Structure

The deployment issue was caused by Vercel not knowing which package to deploy in our monorepo structure. This has been resolved!

## 🎯 Quick Deploy Steps

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your GitHub repository: `Skinz1434/SkinZAI-VBMS`
3. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory**: `StarterKit/web` ← **IMPORTANT: Set this!**
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (auto-detected)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

4. **Environment Variables**: Add these in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/proxy
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=SkinZAI VBMS
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
   API_URL=https://your-backend-api.railway.app
   ```

5. Click **Deploy** 🚀

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to the web directory
cd "StarterKit/web"

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
```

## 🔧 What We Fixed

### 1. **Monorepo Structure**
- ✅ Added `rootDirectory: "StarterKit/web"` to `vercel.json`
- ✅ Updated build commands to work from the correct directory
- ✅ Removed problematic function patterns

### 2. **API Proxy Setup**
- ✅ Moved API proxy from serverless functions to Next.js rewrites
- ✅ Configured `next.config.js` for proper routing
- ✅ Removed the conflicting `/app/api/proxy` directory

### 3. **Build Configuration**
- ✅ Added `output: 'standalone'` for Vercel optimization
- ✅ Configured proper TypeScript and Tailwind setup
- ✅ Added environment variable handling

## 🎯 Current Project Structure

```
SkinZAI VBMS/
├── vercel.json              ← Vercel configuration (fixed)
├── StarterKit/
│   └── web/                 ← Root directory for Vercel
│       ├── package.json     ← Next.js dependencies
│       ├── next.config.js   ← Next.js config (updated)
│       ├── tailwind.config.js
│       ├── app/
│       │   ├── layout.tsx
│       │   ├── page.tsx
│       │   └── globals.css
│       └── ...
└── [Other modules...]
```

## 🌐 Backend Deployment

For the complete system, you'll also need to deploy the backend:

### Railway (Recommended)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project from GitHub
3. Deploy the `StarterKit/api` directory
4. Add PostgreSQL database
5. Update the `API_URL` in Vercel environment variables

### Alternative: Render
1. Use the included `render.yaml`
2. Deploy backend services
3. Update environment variables

## ✅ Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. **Frontend loads**: Your Vercel URL shows the SkinZAI VBMS interface
2. **API connectivity**: Check `/api/proxy/health` (if backend is running)
3. **Environment variables**: Check that settings are applied correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
- Ensure Root Directory is set to `StarterKit/web`
- Check that all dependencies are in the package.json
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### API Not Working?
- Update `API_URL` environment variable with your backend URL
- Ensure CORS is configured on your backend
- Check backend is deployed and accessible

## 🎉 Success!

Your SkinZAI VBMS should now deploy successfully to Vercel. The monorepo issue is resolved, and the project structure is optimized for deployment.

**Deploy URL**: Will be provided by Vercel after successful deployment
**GitHub**: https://github.com/Skinz1434/SkinZAI-VBMS
