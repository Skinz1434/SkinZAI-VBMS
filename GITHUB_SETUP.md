# GitHub Setup Instructions

Your project has been successfully initialized with Git and the initial commit has been created.

## Current Status

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ .gitignore file created
✅ README.md created with comprehensive documentation
✅ Initial commit created with 282 files
✅ Core modules committed (excluding large Mock eFolder data files)

## Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository (e.g., `skinzai-vbms`)
3. Set it to Private or Public as desired
4. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "Z:/projects/SkinZAI VBMS"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/skinzai-vbms.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin master
```

### 3. (Optional) Add Remaining Files

If you want to add the Mock eFolder and Full PR directories:

```bash
# Add Mock eFolder (contains many sample data files)
git add "Mock eFolder/"
git commit -m "Add Mock eFolder sample data"

# Add Full PR
git add "Full PR/"
git commit -m "Add Full PR module"

# Push updates
git push
```

## Repository Structure

Your repository contains:

- **StarterKit**: Main application (FastAPI + Next.js)
- **Auth RBAC Pack**: Authentication service
- **Correspondence Builder**: Document generation
- **Decision Builder Pack**: Claims processing
- **Search OCR**: Document search and OCR
- **MS ML Pack**: Machine learning components
- **UI Polish Demo Pack**: Enhanced UI components
- **CI QA Security Pack**: Testing and CI/CD
- **Cloud Deployment Pack**: Deployment configurations
- **Observability Ops**: Monitoring stack

## Important Notes

- The Mock eFolder directory contains many sample files and was excluded from the initial commit to keep it manageable
- All sensitive data should remain in .env files (already in .gitignore)
- The project uses synthetic data only for development

## GitHub Actions

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows in `CI QA Security Pack/.github/workflows/` for:
- Continuous Integration (ci.yml)
- Security scanning (security.yml)
- Deployment to Vercel (in Cloud Deployment Pack)

These will activate once pushed to GitHub.

## Support

For any issues with the codebase, refer to the documentation in each module's `docs/` directory.
